- Hi, I’m @MKosh
- I'm a Scientific Software Developer for NASA
- I’m interested in physics, programming, simulations, machine learning, data analysis, and more

I have a bachelor's and Master's in physics. During my bachelor's I studied cosmic ray astrophysics and build a water Cherenkov detector to detect high energy cosmic rays. My Master's research involved using machine learning models to search for vector boson scattering events in the CMS detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. I'm currently a scientific software developer working on data pipeline tools for satellite observatories. This work mostly involves working in C++, but occasionally includes Python, and Perl.

My side projects include:
- sim3D: an OpenGL learning project to get a foundation in graphics programming and visualizations. It's intended to be used for adding 3D visuals to computational physics projects. My current goal is to get the library to the point where it can visualize a molecular dynamics simulation, but might expand to other simulations.
- EAL (Exploratory Analysis Library): A library for interfacing with collections of ROOT files for easy machine learning with TMVA and follow up analysis. Started as an offshoot of my Master's thesis work. (Not currently in developement, but I might go back to it when I have more time)
- Learning computational physics and software development/engineering (specifically using C++).
