- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MKosh
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in physics, programming, data analysis, machine learning

I'm currently finishing my master's degree in physics at Northern Illinois University.

My side projects include:
- EAL - Exploratory Analysis Library
  - A library for interfacing with collections of ROOT files for easy machine learning with TMVA and follow up analysis.
- Learning computational physics with C++ and learning more C++ in general.
