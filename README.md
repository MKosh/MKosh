- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MKosh
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in physics, programming, simulations, machine learning, and more

I have a bachelor's and Master's in physics. During my bachelor's I studied cosmic ray astrophysics and build a water Cherenkov detector to detect high energy cosmic rays. My Master's thesis involved using machine learning models to search for vector boson scattering events at the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. I'm currently a scientific software developer working on analysis tools for astronomical data from satellite observatories. This work mostly involves working in C++, but occasionally includes Python, Perl, and other scripting languages.

My side projects include:
- EAL - Exploratory Analysis Library
  - A library for interfacing with collections of ROOT files for easy machine learning with TMVA and follow up analysis. (not currently in developement, but I might go back to it when I have more time)
- Learning computational physics with C++ and learning more C++ in general.
- Learning OpenGL and graphics programming to provide visualizations for physics simulations
